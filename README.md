Project Overview
Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided several datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

Business Use Cases
By analyzing the provided data, we aim to:

Identify key insights to enhance marketing strategies
Optimize inventory management
Improve sales forecasting
Tailor marketing campaigns
Develop better products
Plan effective promotions
Decide on store expansions and optimizations
Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales
Data Preparation and Cleaning
Steps involved in data preparation and cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Check for and appropriately handle any missing values.
Data Type Conversion: Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merging Datasets: Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
Power BI Visualization
The cleaned data was imported into Power BI to create interactive dashboards. Key visualizations include:

Sum of Total Sales by Month: Area chart showing sales trends over time.
Sum of Total Sales and First Product by Category: Pie chart displaying sales distribution by product category.
Sum of Total Sales by Age Group: Bar chart showing sales distribution across different age groups.
Sum of Total Sales and Sum of Number of Orders by Year: Combo chart illustrating yearly performance.
Sum of Square Meters and Earliest Open Date by Store Key: Bar chart correlating store size and sales performance.
Key Insights
Seasonal Trends: Peaks in sales during specific months suggest successful marketing campaigns or high demand periods.
Category Contribution: Cameras and Accessories and Audio are the top-performing product categories.
Age Group Preferences: The 65+ age group contributes the most to sales.
Yearly Performance: A peak in 2019 followed by a decline indicates the need for investigating underlying factors.
Store Performance: Larger stores and those with earlier open dates tend to have higher sales.
